# 2D Shader Development Book I - Foundations - Exercises

These are the Unity project files for the exercises in the first book of the [2D Shader Development Book](http://www.2dshaders.com).

## Exercise 1 - Endless Scroller Background

Open the project called Exercise 1 - Side Scroller Background.
The idea is to use the texture shader we created in the Fragment Shader Basics chapter of the book and modify it to create a background that scrolls infinitely.
Also, youâ€™ll need to be able to set the speed by which it moves using a shader Property.

## Exercise 2 - Blending Modes

Open the scene called Exercise 2 - Blending Modes and go through each of the sprites in the screen (except the background) and make them use the blending mode that its name suggests. For example find the object called Multiply and make it use the Multiply blending mode. Do the same for Alpha Blend, Additive and Subtractive.
This exercise should be easy and quick to do, only remember to keep in mind the blending equation that Unity uses, which was presented in the previous sections.
